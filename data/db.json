      "title": " Journey to the world of open source ",
      "body": "Today during this journey to the world of open source we will talk about some interesting topics.\nImage for post\n‚óè Why should you contribute to open-Source?\nWho contributes to open source projects gets more knowledge of technology and how it will help to understand the internals of that technology works in real-world software development. You will get recognized by your contributions to projects. Students, employers everyone can showcase their work and skills to the world. It provides value in your resume.you can mention that you have contributed to this project. You gain exposure and make a bond with the community and increase your network.\n‚óè How can I find the right projects to contribute?\nGo to the Explore tab on Github. It will show projects based on your interest or write the name of the topic or technology in the search bar on GitHub and choose any project that you liked. Or go to Google Summer of Code‚Äôs website and in the Project tab, you find many interesting and popular projects. You can do the same on Outreachy‚Äôs website.\n‚óè My experience In Contributor‚Äôs Hack\nContributor‚Äôs Hack was my fist open-source program that I participated in. I saw many interesting projects on the website then I selected NeoAlgo To which I was very excited to contribute. The project was about to have in a single place all possible algorithms and data structures in multiple languages. Before working on a project I get more details of projects and I communicate with my project mentor and other fellows. In the period of working on the project, I started to find Good First Issues and issues for beginner, medium, etc as given labels. I found issues that I can solve and I asked the maintainer to assign an issue to me. I solved that issue and did my first Pull Request In contributor‚Äôs hack. The maintainer told me to do changes and also helped me when I faced merged conflict. I did changes and finally, my First PR got merged. Maintainers were focusing on clean and accurate code. During the coding period, I learn How to write clean and effective code. I was super happy and that I can‚Äôt describe it in words. we communicate on the slack channel, I got to know something new every day. The journey was great and that‚Äôs how you can contribute to projects.\n‚óè Best Practice to follow in open source\nLearn git and GitHub first then always read Documentation of projects given in README.md or CONTRIBUTE.md. Fork and clone projects and make different branches for every issue. Don‚Äôt work on the issue that is already assigned to someone and ask politely to assign issues. Communicating with others can always help you in open source contributions. Write clean code and give the necessary information in the Pull Request. Don‚Äôt give up if your PR does not merge. Never stop at any point, try to improve your code and try again.\n‚óè My First PR Get Merged\nI started open source contribution last year, that was a time before Hacktoberfest. I got to know about Open-Source. first I learn the basics of git and Github then I find good first issues on Github and I ask to assign that issue and I find details of the topic of the issue on the internet and after that start to solve an issue. I did my First PR and that got merged. I was really happy to complete my first step towards open source.\nImage for postImage for post\nConclusion: TO start to contribute to open source you don‚Äôt need to learn everything about any technology. You can contribute while learning. just show your skills and work and help others.\nClap üëè if this Article helps you.",
